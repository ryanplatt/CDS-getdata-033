# Readme for Coursera course - Getting and Cleaning Data - Project

The script "run_analysis.R" generates the output required for the assignment.

It can be executed in any directory using the command "source("run_analysis.R")".

Should the data not exist in the directory, the script will download it prior to data processing.

Part 2 of the assignment is stored in q2data

Part 5 of the assignment is stored in q5. Additionally, it is written to "q5.txt" in the same directory.

Further details of implementation can be found commented in the script, and in the codebook in the same directory.
